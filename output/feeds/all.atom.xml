&lt;p&gt;When we first obtained a MindWave EEG, our initial goal was to see if we could
use any type of neural network to classify some sort of dataset that we would record
from the EEG.  We were working on One-Shot learning when we started this project, so
we decided to also use the One-Shot framework with the EEG data.  I worked with my
research partner Sophie Lancaster on this project.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;The MindWave EEG&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="./images/mindwave.jpg" alt="Image of MindWave" width="200"/&gt;
The MindWave EEG is a lightweight and inexpensive brainwave reader produced by the
company &lt;a href="http://neurosky.com"&gt;NeuroSky&lt;/a&gt;.  We were able to read in data to
csv files from the MindWave using an Android application and used python scripts
to parse them, retrieving just the raw values.  We then split this data into several
examples of equal length.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Our Three Datasets&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first dataset we worked with was taken of four different people staring at the 
same image (&lt;strong&gt;Person&lt;/strong&gt; dataset).  Overall, we obtained a total
of 120 samples - 30 from each person.  Due to a problem in our code, we initially
thought this dataset was too easy for our network to learn because it quickly
achieved 100% classification accuracy.  Though we later found this was incorrect (see
&lt;em&gt;Results&lt;/em&gt;), we decided to create two more difficult datasets to examine.  For these 
two datasets, instead of taking data from different people, we recorded one person 
relaxing vs. doing math (&lt;strong&gt;MathRelax&lt;/strong&gt; dataset) as well as staring at photos of both 
violent storms and idyllic beach scenes (&lt;strong&gt;BeachStorm&lt;/strong&gt; dataset).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Our Network&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To attempt to classify the MindWave data, I modified our One-Shot network (see 
LINK HERE!!!!!) to use one-dimensional convolutions to match
the one-dimensional input data from the EEG instead of the
two-dimensiona convolutions (LINK HERE!!!) we had been using on images in all of 
our other networks.  The one-shot framework definitely makes the most sense here
because of the limited amount of data we recorded.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Results&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After initially finding that the networks also achieved 100% accuracy on the two
more difficult datasets, we concluded that there was something wrong with our code.
After significant debugging, we found a small error that caused the networks to only
use a few of the data examples in the training and testing, allowing the network
to easily learn to distinguish between them.  When we fixed this bug, our results
obviously took a major hit.  Our network was no longer able to achieve much better
than chance (50%) accuracy on the &lt;strong&gt;MathRelax&lt;/strong&gt; and &lt;strong&gt;BeachStorm&lt;/strong&gt; datasets.
However, the results on the &lt;strong&gt;Person&lt;/strong&gt; dataset were somewhat promising. With a two 
person subset of this dataset, the network can guess correctly about 75% of the time 
(vs. 50% chance accuracy), and with the full four classes, it can achieve almost 50% 
accuracy (vs. 25% chance).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Future Work&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Though even the performance of our network on the easier &lt;strong&gt;Person&lt;/strong&gt; dataset was 
admittedly not great, it is somewhat impressive that the network is able to 
distinguish between people just by processing the extremely noisy one-dimensional 
data we took from the inexpensive MindWave.  We believe that with a higher-precision 
EEG and a more tightly controlled environment, better results are possible.  It 
could also be the case that a different network structure could be used to better 
classify the data.  We did additionally consider preprocessing our data with a 
fast-fourier transform (FFT) to see if that could help with classifiation, but we had
to move on to other research areas.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are many potential applications for the use of neural networks on brainwave 
data (e.g. personal authentication and helping the paralyzed), making this quite an 
interesting topic to study.  I am very curious to see the inevitable progress the 
deep learning community will make in this field in the coming years.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="budapest"></category><category term="one-shot-learning"></category><category term="neural-networks"></category></entry><entry><title>The second article</title><link href="jmcguinness11.github.io/the-second-article.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2012-12-01T10:02:00-05:00</published><updated>2012-12-01T10:02:00-05:00</updated><author><name>John McGuinness</name></author><id>tag:None,2012-12-01:jmcguinness11.github.io/the-second-article.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;See below intra-site link examples in Markdown format.&lt;/p&gt;
